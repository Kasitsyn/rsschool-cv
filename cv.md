### Code example:

**TWO SUM from CODEWARS:**
*Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).<br>
For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.<br>
The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).*

```javascript
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length-1; i++) {
        for (var j = i+1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
            if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] === target) return [i, j];
        }
    }
}
```
